For this we first prove that $\frac{1}{n}>0 \forall n \in \N$. First we multiply both sides by $n$, since $n \in \N, n > 0$, the sign does not change.
\newline
We get $LHS = 1$ $RHS = 0$, since $1 > 0$ is an axiom, therefore we know that $1/n > 0$.
\newline
Now since we have proven $\frac{1}{n} \geq 0 \forall n \in \N$, by the ordered field axioms $a \leq b$.

Let the set in question be denoted by $S$. We will prove the claim via contradiction. We break its negative down into two cases: $\sup S < a$ or $\sup S > a$.
\newline
For the former, let $x = \sup S | x \in \R$. By the denseness of rationals we see that there exists $q \in \Q s.t. x \leq q \leq a$. By the definition of this set we have $q \in S$. Therefore we have just found a member of this set that is greater than the supremum. This is a contradiciton so $x$ cannot be less than a.
\newline
For the latter, we once again let $x = \sup S | x \in \R$. Consider $a$. $a<x$ and by definition of $S$, $\forall s \in S, s<a$. We have found an upperbound that is less than our supremum. That is a contradiction so $x$ cannot be greater than a.
\newline
$\sup S = a$ Q.E.D.
